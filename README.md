# Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset to uncover insights into sales performance, profitability, and regional trends across various retailers, states, and product categories. My exploration involved a combination of data visualization and statistical analysis, leveraging Tableau to create dashboards that provide a clear view of sales and profit metrics. I used the provided Excel dataset to perform this analysis, focusing on geographic, retailer, and product-specific trends over time.

## Approach

### Data Loading and Cleaning
I began by loading the retail sales dataset into Tableau. I ensured the data was clean by:
- Checking for missing values
- Standardizing formats (e.g., invoice dates)
- Verifying the consistency of categorical variables such as regions and sales methods

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Using Tableau, I explored the dataset to understand sales distribution across states, regions, retailers, and product categories. This involved creating visualizations like maps, bar charts, and scatter plots to identify patterns in sales and profitability.

### Geographic Analysis
I analyzed total sales by state and region to identify high-performing and underperforming areas. A map visualization highlighted sales distribution across the U.S., with a focus on states like New York, California, and Florida, as well as regional breakdowns (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, South, and West).

### Retailer and Product Analysis
I examined sales and profit performance by retailer (e.g., Foot Locker, West Gear, Walmart, Sports Direct, Amazon, Kohl's) and product category (e.g., Men's Street Footwear, Women's Apparel). Stacked bar charts and area charts helped visualize contributions to total sales over time.

### Profitability Analysis
I calculated operating profit and profit margins across states, regions, and sales methods (In-store, Online, Outlet). Scatter plots and bar charts were used to compare units sold against profit margins, revealing correlations between sales volume and profitability.

### Trend Analysis
I analyzed sales and profit trends over time (from December 2019 to December 2021) using line charts to identify seasonal patterns and growth trajectories. Area charts further illustrated how product categories contributed to sales trends.

### Visualization
I created two comprehensive Tableau dashboards to present my findings:
- **Dashboard 1 (Sales and Profit Trends):** Features line charts of sales and profit trends over time, a scatter plot of units sold vs. profit margin, area charts of sales contributions by product category, and a line chart comparing profit margins across sales methods.
- **Dashboard 2 (Geographic Insights):** Includes a U.S. map showing total sales by state, bar charts of highest operating profit by state, regional sales breakdowns by retailer, and a heatmap of regional performance by units sold and profit.

The Tableau file is available in the directory and also uploaded in Tableau Public

## Key Insights

- **Geographic Performance:** New York led with the highest sales at $8,670,464, while Nebraska had the lowest at $728,838. The Northeast region outperformed others with $9,932,969 in sales, followed by the Midwest at $5,274,020.
  
- **Profitability by State:** States like New York, Florida, and California showed the highest operating profits, with New York reaching $2,000M. Alabama and Tennessee also performed well in terms of profit relative to sales volume.

- **Retailer Performance:** Foot Locker and West Gear were the top-performing retailers, contributing significantly to total sales (approximately $30M each). Amazon and Walmart lagged behind in comparison, with sales around $10M each.

- **Product Category Trends:** Men's and Women's Street Footwear were the dominant product categories, showing consistent growth in sales from 2019 to 2021, with a peak around mid-2021. Women's Apparel also contributed significantly but showed more fluctuation.

- **Sales Method Insights:** In-store sales maintained a consistently high profit margin (around 30%) from 2020 to 2021, while online and outlet sales methods showed more variability, with online sales peaking in profitability during certain periods.

- **Profit Margin Analysis:** There is a positive correlation between units sold and profit margin, with higher sales volumes generally leading to better profitability. However, this varies by sales method, with in-store sales showing the most stable profit margins.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides actionable insights for retailers to optimize their strategies, focusing on high-performing regions, product categories, and sales methods while addressing underperforming areas. The visualizations and findings can guide decision-making to improve sales and profitability.
